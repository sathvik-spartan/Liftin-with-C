# Liftin-with-C
This simple project showcases various modern lift/elevator configurations    

- When Bangalore traffic hits hard, your ever evolving curiosity and thought process suddenly start working at full capacity and all you can think of is how a lift / an elevator works.
- I wrote this code while in traffic but i somehow managed to optimise it further (yeah, i'm kinda insane).
- Update : I've optimised the hope and i'm hoping for a code review
- I really wish these were the commit messages but anyways here you go... Enjoy the simulation, folks!
- Main.c is the main file (optimization imminent)


Contributions are most welcome and valued.    

## Recommended by the community 
1. Will hopefully add GUI for more graphical advantage.
2. Implement logic for user defined total floors (Skyscraper logic). -> this will be done only if needed and will further be implemented in the client side.
