# Liftin-with-C
This simple project showcases various modern lift/elevator configurations    

- When Bangalore traffic hits hard, your ever evolving curiosity and thought process suddenly start working at full capacity and all you can think of is how a lift / an elevator works.
- I wrote this code while in traffic but i somehow managed to optimise it further (yeah, i'm kinda insane).
- I really wish these were the commit messages but anyways here you go... Enjoy the code folks!


Contributions are most welcome and valued.
