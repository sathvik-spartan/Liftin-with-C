The documentation of Test_lift.c is displayed here : 

This is a terminal based elevator simulation with the following features : 

1. Up / Down hall calls 
2. Cabin (inside lift) calls
3. Automatic direction logic
4. Stops at the correct floors 

So, what does this simulation show ? 

1. Multi-floor logic (0–9 floors)
2. Up/down request handling
3. Direction logic
4. Door opening at correct floors
5. Idle behavior
6. Can be extended to multiple lifts or embedded logic
